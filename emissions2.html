		<h1>NO, INDYGO ISN’T GREEN</h1>

		<p>A popular misconception that IndyGo helped create by, e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/IndyGoBus/status/462283515711586304">tweeting</a> the following graph is that IndyGo buses emit less carbon dioxide than the cars they arguably replace.  At least in IndyGo's case, the truth is just the opposite: cars cause less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger-mile than the average IndyGo bus does.</p>
		<img src="CO2 Emissions per IndyGo.jpg">

		<p>Let's set aside the fact that not all the graph's numbers are true.  (Since burning gasoline emits <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.cfm">19.6 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per gallon</a>, for example, a 48-city-mpg Prius carrying only as single passenger would emit only 0.4 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger-mile, not the graph's 0.6.)  One problem is that the graph doesn't take into account that according to <a href="https://www.indygo.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2009.pdf">on-board surveys</a> the alternative to half the rides would not be cars.  And it takes advantage of a well-known statistical illusion: since most bus riders spend most of their riding time on parts of the route where most riders do, riders get a false impression of buses' average occupancy.  They don't see that most IndyGo buses are nearly empty most of the time.  On average, in fact, IndyGo buses carry less than six simultaneous riders.<sup><span id="r1"><a href="#n1">1</a></span></sup></p>

		<p>The upshot is that IndyGo emits more CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger-mile than cars do even before we take into account that only half the bus rides displace car rides.  IndyGo provided only 18.8<sup><span id="r2"><a href="#n2">2</a></span></sup> passenger-miles per gallon of diesel fuel in 2018, or the carbon-dioxide equivalent of 16.4<sup><span id="r3"><a href="#n3">3</a></span></sup> passenger-miles per gallon of gasoline.  That means IndyGo emits nearly twice as much carbon dioxide per passenger-mile as a 24-mpg car that averages 1.25 passengers.  And that comparison is likely to get worse.  The projection of the Hogsett Administration’s <i><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b4ead40c3c16a711ae78401/t/5c704aa4fa0d6033019e373a/1550863041205/2019CPSR001-ThriveIndianapolis-web.pdf">Thrive Indianapolis</a></i> plan, in fact, is that even by 2025, when the Red, Purple, and Blue Lines are all in operation, the ridership increase garnered by the expansion’s 70% increase in bus miles could be as low as 15%: bus occupancy could decrease by as much as a third.</p>

		<p>Of course, IndyGo likes to emphasize its electric buses and <a href="https://www.indygo.net/feature-indygos-bus-fleet-powered-by-solar-panels/">claim</a> that they are powered by solar panels.  But at least initially its diesel buses will provide most of the added bus miles.  Even IndyGo admits it won't be all-electric before 2035.  And, although solar panels do provide power without emitting CO<sub>2</sub>, they're a red herring in this context.</p>
		
		<p>Think about it.  If the buses weren't running, the solar panels would still be reducing Indanapolis's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: they'd be powering IndyGo's buildings and/or the grid.  Indeed, since almost all bus charging will occur either at night or at locations remote from the solar array, the bulk of the solar-panel output will power IndyGo's buildings or the grid even when all buses are electric.  If the array does charge a bus directly, moreover, the IPL has to burn more fossil fuel to generate the electricity that the solar panels don't provide for other purposes.<sup><span id="r4"><a href="#n4">4</a></span></sup>  So adding more bus miles will increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, whether IndyGo has solar panels or not.</p>
		
		<p>That's not to say that IndyGo's conversion to electric, glacial though it may be, won't reduce IndyGo's emissions.  It could be argued, for example, that IndyGo's emissions per passenger-mile before its expansion would not have far exceeded cars' if its fleet had been all-electric.  To see this let's call IndyGo's electric-bus mileage half a mile per kilowatt-hour even though it's actual mileage is probably less than that.<sup><span id="r5"><a href="#n5">5</a></span></sup>  Under that assumption the electricity for the roughly <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/August%202019%20Adjusted%20Database.xlsx">7.4 million</a> total bus miles IndyGo drove in 2018 would have resulted in IPL's emitting about 22 million pounds of carbon dioxide<sup><span id="r6"><a href="#n6">6</a></span></sup>.  That’s equivalent to about 31.4 passenger-miles per gallon of gasoline,<sup><span id="r7"><a href="#n7">7</a></span></sup> the same as that of a 24-mpg car averaging 1.3 passengers (i.e., the average if, e.g., 76% of cars carried only a single passenger, 18% carried two, 4% carried three, 1% carried four and a fraction of a percent carried more).</p>

		<p>That calculation isn't exact, of course.  Again, electric-bus mileage is probably worse than the half-mile per kilowatt-hour we assumed.  On the other hand, IPL's marginal rate of emission&mdash;which is really the measure more appropriate for assessing changes to electricity demand&mdash;may be less than the above-assumed 1.5-lb/kWh average rate.  For example, it would be more like 1.2 lbs/kWh if natural gas provides all the additional power.  And perhaps car occupancy is less than 1.3; although 1.3 is less than the overall national average of 1.6, the occupancy value given in Alain Bertaud's <i>Order without Design</i> for intra-city driving is 1.25.</p>
		
		<p>So the comparison seems close: it's not clear whether an all-electric fleet would have caused more or less emissions per passenger-mile than passenger cars.  Most likely, though, downsizing IndyGo or shuttering it entirely would have reduced Indianapolis CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, because only half the erstwhile bus riders would have made their trips by car (or taxi, Uber, etc.).</p>

		<p>But isn't IPL's fuel mix changing?  Isn't it moving toward more wind and solar?  Well, given the experiences that places like Germany, Spain, and California have had with those unreliable energy sources, it's questionable that IPL will reach its goal of 35% wind and solar by 2036.  Still, doing so would reduce indeed IPL's average emissions per kilowatt-hour by about a third, to around 1.0 lbs/kWh.  Again, though, the more-appropriate measure in this context is  the marginal rate, which would likely remain natural gas's 1.2 lbs/kWh, implying an effective mileage increase to only about 39 pmpg.  Meanwhile, cars’ efficiency will be increasing as older cars are retired.  Since new passenger cars were averaging <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/average-fuel-efficiency-us-light-duty-vehicles">37.7 mpg</a> in 2016 instead of 24 mpg, cars' passenger-mileage would likely continue to exceed buses', approaching, say, 1.25 passengers × 37.7 mpg = 47 pmpg.  So, given that not all bus rides replace car rides, an all-electric IndyGo would probably still have caused more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger-mile than the cars it displaced.</p>

		<p>And that's all without IndyGo's expansion, which will almost certainly make its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger-mile worse.  Here again the statistical illusion will create a false impression.  Attention will be drawn to a few popular routes, such as the Red Line, which will enjoy relatively high occupancy.  But most of the expansion's added bus miles will be provided by emptier buses on other routes as each increment of additional ridership becomes harder to attract.</p>

		<p>The resultant reduction in IndyGo's already-low average bus occupancy will increase its emissions per passenger-mile.  Indeed, the above-mentioned <i><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b4ead40c3c16a711ae78401/t/5c704aa4fa0d6033019e373a/1550863041205/2019CPSR001-ThriveIndianapolis-web.pdf">Thrive Indianapolis</a></i> projection means an all-electric IndyGo would be averaging as few as 8.4 additional passenger-miles per gallon-equivalent of electricity<sup><span id="r8"><a href="#n8">8</a></span></sup>.  Even in an all-electric IndyGo, that is, the expansion would add many times as much CO<sub>2</sub> emission per added passenger-mile as the cars it displaces.  And the real-world IndyGo's expansion will be even worse.</p>

		<p>We hasten to add that ridership may well increase more than the Hogsett administration's projection.  Even in the unlikely event that the ridership increase is four times the projection, though, emissions per passenger-mile will still increase.  So the proposition that the expansion is "environmentally friendly" is delusional.</p>

		<p>Despite its solar panels and gradual conversion to electric buses, IndyGo causes more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than the cars it may displace.   If what we're interested in is reducing Indianapolis's carbon footprint, the right choice would be to shutter IndyGo, or at least downsize it to the few popular routes on which it emits less than cars.  Doing to would also reduce residents' aggregate transportation expense.</p>

		<p><sup><span id="n1"><a href="#r1">1</a></span></sup>IndyGo <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/50050_0.pdf">reported</a> to the Federal Transit Administration that it took 6,987,094 bus miles to provide 39,860,927 passenger-miles in its best recent ridership year, 2014.  And 39,860,927 passenger-miles ÷ 6,987,094 bus miles = an average of 5.7 simultaneous passengers per IndyGo bus.</p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n2"><a href="#r2">2</a></span></sup>Bus rides average about 4 miles in length.  (For example, IndyGo’s <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/50050_0.pdf">report</a> to the Federal Transit Administration for 2014, its best recent ridership year, says it provided 10,292,609 bus rides for a total of 39,860,927 passenger-miles, or 3.9 miles per bus ride.)  And IndyGo provided <a href="https://www.indygo.net/about-indygo/transit-planning/">8,814,529</a> bus rides in 2018 by burning an estimated <a href="https://www.indygo.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2018-Budget-Book_08.24.17_Final_With-Board-Signatures.pdf">1,875,000</a> gallons of fuel.  If we do the math we see that 8,814,529 bus rides × 4 miles/ride ÷ 1,875,000 gallons ≈ 18.8 pmpg.</p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n3"><a href="#r3">3</a></span></sup>According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.cfm">EIA</a>), gasoline combustion emits 19.6 lbs. carbon dioxide per gallon, whereas diesel fuel emits 22.4.  In CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions terms 18.8 miles mpg of diesel is equivalent to  16.4 mpg of gasoline: 19.6 ÷ 22.4 × 18.8 = 16.4.</p>

		<p><sup><span id="n4"><a href="#r4">4</a></span></sup>Actually, charging buses directly from the solar array would save in transmission loss, so it would be more efficient than using the array to help power the grid.  But that's unlikely to prove practical to any great extent. Anyway, the solar array is only a fraction of the size that power an all-electric IndyGo would require.</p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n5"><a href="#r5">5</a></span></sup>IndyGo’s electric-bus supplier, BYD, claims half a mile per kilowatt-hour for its 60-foot bus, but in reality the mileage is less.  According to <a href="https://www.indygo.net/feature-indygos-bus-fleet-powered-by-solar-panels/">IndyGo</a>, its 60-foot buses "have a battery capacity of 642 kWh with 80% usable energy,"  and an <i>Indianapolis Business Journal</i> <a href="">article</a> reported an average range of 206 miles, implying something more like 0.4 mi/kWh, depending upon exactly what those reports meant by "usable energy" and exactly what the battery conditions for the reported ranges were.  For BYD’s smaller, 40-foot bus, an independent test is <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/01/20140125-byd.html">reported</a> to have found half a mile per kilowatt-hour&mdash;but that was without heat or air conditioning. </p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n6"><a href="#r6">6</a></span></sup>We infer about 1.5 lbs. CO<sub>2</sub> per socket kWh from EIA <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.cfm">emissions figures</a>, IPL’s 2018 <a href="https://www.iplpower.com/About_IPL/Power_Generation/">fuel mix</a> of 44% coal (0.72 lb/kWh), 45% gas (0.40 lb/kWh), 8% wind, 2% solar, and 1% oil (0.59 lb/kWh) and the 3.03 ratio of combustion power to socket power inferred from the ratio of 10,339 Btu to 3412 Btu (1 kWh) in Table B.6 of Oak Ridge National Laboratories’ <a href="https://cta.ornl.gov/data/appendix_b.shtml">Transportation Energy Data Book</a>.  7.4 million bus miles ÷ ½ mile/kWh × 1.5 lbs. CO<sub>2</sub> per socket kWh = 22 million lbs. CO<sub>2</sub>.  </p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n7"><a href="#r7">7</a></span></sup>8,814,529 bus rides × 4 miles/ride ÷ 22 million lbs CO<sub>2</sub> × 19.6 lbs CO<sub>2</sub>/gallon of gasoline = 31.4 miles per gallon of gasoline.</p>
		
		<p><sup><span id="n8"><a href="#r8">8</a></span></sup>31.4 pmpg × 1.5 lb/kWh ÷ 1.2 lb/kWh × 15% more passenger-miles ÷ 70% more bus miles = 8.4 additional passenger-miles per gallon equivalent.</p>
