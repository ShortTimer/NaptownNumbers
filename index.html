        <h1>Naptown Numbers</h1>
		<p>Let's have some quantitative context.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="col-sm-9">
	  <p>You want apples, I have the kind you want to buy, and I'll sell you apples for $10.  Do we have a deal?</p>
	  
	  <p>Your answer is probably no, or at least not yet.  We don't have a deal yet because there's a number missing.  You know the price is $10, but you don't know how many apples you'll get for that price.  In private transactions, you usually insist on knowing the numbers.</p>
	  
	  <p>In public policy, not so much.  Numbers are often completely absent, and those that do appear are often irrelevant or misleading.  This site deals with those missing and misleading numbers.</p>
	  
	  <p>It's called <i>Naptown</i> Numbers because it was inspired by a campaign to impose the transit tax that's funding expanded operations of IndyGo, the city-bus company in "Naptown" (Indianapolis).  Together with other government-funded organizations such as the Central Indiana Regional Transit Authority and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, IndyGo must have made hundreds of presentations at meetings in support of the tax.  Many of them did give the price: an added $54 million/year.  (More-recent reports say it's come in at $58 million.).  But what about the quantity?  Instead of apples, IndyGo was selling human transportation: passenger-miles.  And, so far as we know, the campaign never divulged the expected increase in passenger-miles or at least bus rides.</p>
